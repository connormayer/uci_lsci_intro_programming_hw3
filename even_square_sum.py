# Write code that calculates the sum of the square of every even 
# number in the list below and prints it (that is, you take each

# You can use a list comprehension or a regular loop. You can also
# use the sum function to sum the values in a list if it's helpful.
# sum(<list>)
# 
# For the list below, your code should print 44984
