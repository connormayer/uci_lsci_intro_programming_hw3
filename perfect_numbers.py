# A perfect number is a number such that the sum of its proper divisors is equal to
# itself. A proper devisor is any divisor of that number not equal to the number itself.
#
# For example, 6 is a perfect number because its proper divisors are 1, 2 and 3, 
# and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
#
# Write a function called find_perfect_numbers that takes a single integer as an argument
# and returns a list of all the perfect numbers up to and including that integer. For example,
# if I pass in 500, I should get [6, 28, 496] back. I should get the same result if I pass in 496.
#
# There are clever ways to do this, but it's easy to find the solution using a simple strategy
# that requires no mathematical sophistication.
#
# A few tips:
#   - the largest possible divisor of a integer n is n/2, rounded down
#   - it may take your code a while to run if you pass in large numbers
