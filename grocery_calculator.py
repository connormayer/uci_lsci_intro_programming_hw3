# Write a program that asks the user to input their grocery list
# and then tells them the price. You can make the following two
# assumptions:
# - the only available groceries are:
#       - bread: $3
#       - eggs: $6
#       - milk: $4
#       - butter: $2
# - users must enter one item at a time, even if they are buying
#   multiple
#       - e.g. if the user is buying three loaves of bread, they
#         will have to input 'bread' 3 times.
#
# If the user inputs something that is not one of the four options
# above, the program should print "The store doesn't have that" and
# then prompt the user for more input.
#
# When the user inputs an empty line (i.e. hits enter without typing
# anything), the program should print the total cost of their groceries.
#
# For example:
# Input grocery item:
# >> bread
# Input next grocery item:
# >> milk
# Input next grocery item
# >>
# Your total grocery bill is $7
