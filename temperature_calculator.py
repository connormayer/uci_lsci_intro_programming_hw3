# Write a program that continuously prompts the user for a 
# temperture (in the scale of your choosing). Every time 
# the user inputs a temperature, the program should report 
# the mean of all the values entered so far. When the user
# types in 'quit' the program should terminate.
#
# An example interaction might look like
# Input a temperature
# >> 42
# The average temperature so far is 42
# Input a temperature
# >> 26
# The average temperature so far is 34.0
# Input a temperature
# >> 52
# The average temperature so far is 40.0
# >> quit
# Goodbye
#
# You can use the sum function to sum all the values in a list
# sum(<list>)
