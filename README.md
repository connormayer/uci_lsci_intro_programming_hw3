The second homework assignment from LSCI 109: Introduction to Programming for Language Science

This homework consists of 5 problems in the following four files
* multilingual_greeter.py
* perfect_numbers.py
* triple_finder.py
* unigram_probability.py - this file contains two problems

Each Python script has some code that you will need to fill in. Descriptions of each problem can be found in comments in the scripts.

Note that these problems (and problems going forward) will generally ask you to RETURN values rather than printing them.

Instructions for how to submit your assignment can be found in the Lab 2 handout.

The tests folder contains the tests that will be used to grade your assignment. Do not modify these tests (your assignment will be flagged in the system if you do), but feel free to look at them.
